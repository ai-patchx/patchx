# Icon Placeholder

Place the PatchX VS Code extension icon here as `icon.png`.

Recommended specifications:
- Size: 128x128 pixels
- Format: PNG
- Background: Transparent or solid color
- Design: Simple, recognizable icon representing PatchX (patch upload / submit / status, or diff symbols)

Suggested design elements:
- Diff symbols (- / +)
- Patch/document sheet
- Upload/submit arrow
- A small "X" or "PX" monogram for PatchX

The extension can run without an icon, but providing one is recommended for publishing to the marketplace.
